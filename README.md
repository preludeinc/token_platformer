## Final Project for ICS223 - "Token Platformer"

The player's objective is to collect all coins and then to find their friend BMO.
The player can jump, dash, attack (both by jumping on enemies and by using his sword), and drop down from platforms.
Enemies will follow the player using A\* pathfinding, and will attack within a certain radius.
An audiomixer assists with volume controls, and a confetti particle effect is displayed on player win.

Scripts are located in the [following](./Assets/Scripts) folder.
